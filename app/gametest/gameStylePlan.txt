the game flow will be like the following: 

any enemy ships will be spawned in the beggining, 
- toast message appear
- add event log,

when user click on the enemy ship (first time he see it):
- they will have (5 seconds) Modal popup dialog to learn about the issue and explain the what is that ship and what to do, 

if the user select the correct answer then the ship is bombed by our army,

second time same ship type will come, only: 

relatively with the score, the gmae will be like the following: 
1- first send 2 basic ships, only answer is bomb them, until they are done,
2- when (totalDestroyedShips = 2 basic), send ship with first issue (fade) alone until its figured out, 
3- send basic ships and fade ship for sometime, 
4- when (totalDestroyedShips = 8 , 4 basic and 4 fade), send ship with jumping issue alone until its figured out,
5- send basic, fade, jumping at the same time until specefic totalDestroyedShips,
6- send ship with ghost issue alone until its figured out, 
7- send basic, fade, jumping, ghosting at the same time until specefic totalDestroyedShips,
8- send ship with slow issue alone until its figured out, 
9- send basic, fade, jumping, ghosting, slow at the same time until specefic totalDestroyedShips,
10- send ship with blackout issue alone until its figured out, 
11- send basic, fade, jumping, ghosting, slow, blackout at the same time until specefic totalDestroyedShips,
12- send ship with SNR issue alone until its figured out, 
13- as now we finished all the issues, we send all basic, fade, jumping, ghosting at the same time, in random way and contious,

notes:

any ship hit the port will be respawned,
every ship scenario must be learned by the dialog one time then it will be drop down selection without dialog

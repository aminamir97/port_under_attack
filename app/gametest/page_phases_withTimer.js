/* meeting notes for the gameplay:
there will be new type of ship which is the easy enemy ship, one click and select bomb option to destroy it.

1. normal ships are coming with no issues and the player can click on them to get info and destroy them easily.
2. then we introduce first issue (fade) and the normal ships,
3. until the player learn it, then there will be normal ships and the same fade issue ship but now the player know about it for sometime (ex. bomb 3 of them).
4. then we introduce the jump issue with noraml ships and no fade issue until user learn it,
5. then we have normal ships, fade issue ships (learned) and jump issue ships (learned) for sometime, 
6. then we introduce slow issue with normal ships only,until they user learn it,
7. then we have normal ships, fade issue ships (learned) and jump issue ships (learned) and third issue ships (learned) for sometime, 
8. then we introduce ghost issue with normal ships only, until they user learn it,
9. then we have normal ships, fade issue ships (learned) and jump issue ships (learned) and third issue ships (learned) and ghost issue ships (learned) for sometime, 
10.then we introduce blackout issue with normal ships only, until they user learn it,
11. then we have normal ships, fade issue ships (learned) and jump issue ships (learned) and third issue ships (learned) and ghost issue ships (learned) and blackout issue ships (learned) for sometime, 
12. then we introduce SNR issue with normal ships only, until they user learn it,
13. then we have normal ships, fade issue ships (learned) and jump issue ships (learned) and third issue ships (learned) and ghost issue ships (learned) and blackout issue ships (learned) and SNR issue ships (learned) for sometime, 
14. finally we have all types of ships with all issues (all learned) for the final phase.
15 when user get specefic score we increase the speed,
